# To-do-list-with-Django-framework
 + This is a to-do-list built on the Django python framework.  
 + Users get authenticated to login and access their tasks where they can create or modify tasks.  
 + The web app implements the basic CRUD operations for interacting with the database.  
 + Django Class Based Views(CBVs) are used to leverage DRY practices.
 
 + Run <pip install -r requirements.txt> in your project directory to replicate this virtual environment
